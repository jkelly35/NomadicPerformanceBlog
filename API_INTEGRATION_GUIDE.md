const weather = await getWeatherForActivity(userLat, userLon);
if (!weather.isGoodForOutdoorActivity) {
  showWarning("Consider indoor alternatives due to weather");
}
```

## ü•ó Nutrition APIs

### Option 1: Nutritionix (Free tier: 500 calls/month)

import { searchExercises, getWgerExercises } from '@/lib/exercise-api';

// Get exercises for specific body part
const backExercises = await searchExercises('back');
const allExercises = await getWgerExercises(50);
```

## üó∫Ô∏è Location & Geocoding APIs

**API**: OpenStreetMap Nominatim + Overpass API (Completely free)
**Use Case**: Finding nearby trails, local fitness facilities

### Features:
- Address geocoding
- Reverse geocoding
- Nearby trail discovery
- Location-based recommendations

### Implementation:
```typescript
import { geocodeLocation, searchNearbyTrails } from '@/lib/location-api';

// Find trails near user
const trails = await searchNearbyTrails(userLat, userLon, 25);

// Geocode location search
const locations = await geocodeLocation("Yosemite National Park");
```

## üè• Health Device APIs (Future Integration)

### Apple HealthKit
- **Platform**: iOS only
- **Data**: Heart rate, HRV, steps, workouts, sleep
- **Integration**: Requires iOS app with HealthKit entitlements

### Google Fit
- **Platform**: Android
- **Data**: Similar to HealthKit
- **Integration**: OAuth 2.0 flow

### Fitbit API
- **Free tier**: 150 calls/hour
- **Data**: Comprehensive fitness tracking
- **Integration**: OAuth 2.0

## üöÄ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Weather & Location)
1. **Weather Integration**: Add weather checks to training pages
2. **Trail Discovery**: Help users find local outdoor activities

### Phase 2: Nutrition Enhancement
1. **Food Search**: Enhance nutrition logging with API data
2. **Recipe Analysis**: Add nutritional analysis to meal planning

### Phase 3: Exercise Intelligence
1. **Exercise Recommendations**: Suggest exercises based on goals
2. **Workout Variations**: Provide alternatives for equipment availability

### Phase 4: Health Data Integration
1. **Apple HealthKit**: iOS users get personalized insights
2. **Cross-platform**: Add Google Fit and Fitbit support

## üìä User Experience Improvements

### Personalized Recommendations
- Weather-based activity suggestions
- Location-aware trail recommendations
- Equipment-based exercise alternatives

### Enhanced Tracking
- Accurate nutrition data
- Comprehensive exercise database

## üîß Technical Considerations

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const data = await apiCall();
  return data;
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('API unavailable:', error);
  return fallbackData;
}
```

### Caching Strategy
- Cache API responses for 1 hour
- Use React Query or SWR for data fetching
- Implement offline fallbacks

### Rate Limiting
- Implement request throttling
- Show loading states during API calls
- Provide offline functionality

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Start with Weather API** - Easiest to implement, immediate user value
2. **Add Location Features** - Enhance outdoor activity planning
3. **Integrate Nutrition APIs** - Improve food logging accuracy
4. **Plan HealthKit Integration** - Long-term personalized features
